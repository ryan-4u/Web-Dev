        <h1><b>IRON MAN</b></h1>
        <p>Right now,
            MCU fans everywhere are waiting in an
            ticipation for the release of Avengers: 
            Doomsday, not just because it’s the next big event-movie 
            of the franchise, but because it will see the return of iconic 
            Iron Man actor, Robert Downey Jr. Rdj’s Tony Stark sacrificed 
            himself in Avengers: Endgame, but that won’t be enough
            to prevent his return in Avengers:
            Doomsday, especially since he won’t be coming back 
            as Tony Stark, but another character altogether: 
            Doctor Doom. And, if the MCU wants to do this story right, 
            it needs to lean on a forgotten Iron Man plot in Marvel Comics.
