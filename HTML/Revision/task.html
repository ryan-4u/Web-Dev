Create a new HTML file called index.html. Add the basic boilerplate: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>.

Inside the body, add a heading (<h1>) saying “Welcome to My Web Page” and a paragraph (<p>) with a short introduction about yourself.

Add an image tag (<img>) with a sample image (you can use a free-image URL) and include alt text describing the image.

Add a navigation list: use <ul> with three <li> items. In each list item, include an <a> anchor link that points to # (placeholder) with link text like “Home”, “About”, “Contact”.

Create a second HTML page named about.html. Link to it from the “About” link in your index.html. Then in about.html add some heading & paragraphs describing what you’ll learn or build in web development.

On index.html, add a table (<table>) with 2-3 rows and 2 columns: e.g., Column headings: “Topic” & “Status”; rows: “HTML Basics” / “Done”, “CSS Basics” / “In Progress”.

In index.html, create a simple form: <form> with one text input (<input type="text">) for “Name”, one email input (<input type="email">) for “Email”, and a submit button.

Add semantic tags: wrap your main content in <main>, add a <header> with your page title, and a <footer> with your name and current year.

Use at least one list of another type: e.g., an ordered list (<ol>) below the table with three items of things you want to learn next (e.g., “CSS Grid”, “JavaScript Basics”, “Responsive Design”).

Validate your HTML: open your page in a browser, inspect for errors, and optionally use the free validator at Nu Html Checker (or simply check that it shows correctly and no tags appear broken).
